# Udemy Angular Practice
Udemy Course and Other Angular Projects for Practice

In taking this full Angluar Udemy course, I wanted to make all the practice examples available to share and also my own personal reuses as well. :-)

Update 5/29/2019 - These practice examples were all based on Angular 7.  Angular has been updated to Angular 8 and here is the refactoring that can be done to make sure you are updated appropriately, https://update.angular.io/#7.0:8.0

# Description (Brief text on what the project is about)

# Dependencies (List of libs and tools the projects uses or need to run)

# Getting Started (Steps to spin up the project)

# Contribution (Section on how to contribute and what not)

# Troubleshooting (Gotchas that most folks come across when working with your project)

# Roadmap (Future changes you wish to add toy our project)
